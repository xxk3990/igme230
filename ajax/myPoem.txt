<p id = "verse1">Whose cat is that? I think I know.<br>
Its owner is quite happy though.<br>
Full of joy like a vivid rainbow,<br>
I watch him laugh. I cry hello.<br></p>

<p id = "verse2">He gives his cat a shake,<br>
And laughs until her belly aches.<br>
The only other sound's the break,<br>
Of distant waves and birds awake.<br></p>

<p id = "verse3">The cat is small, happy and deep,<br>
But he has promises to keep,<br>
After cake and lots of sleep.<br>
Sweet dreams come to him cheap.<br></p>

<p id = "verse4">He rises from his gentle bed,<br>
With thoughts of kittens in his head,<br>
He eats his jam with lots of bread.<br>
Ready for the day ahead.<br></p>
